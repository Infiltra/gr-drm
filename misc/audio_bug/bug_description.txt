Bug Description

The use of audio_sink in combination with DRM Audio Encoder / Decoder seems to 
corrupt the data.

When executing audio_corrupted, file sizes are as expected until the short to 
float block after the decoder is reached. Input seems to be okay, as it can be 
played back with aplay. Output of the conversion block is about 1/8 of the input 
but should be exactly twice.

The bug does not occur when the audio sink is replaced by a null sink or when
the DRM encoder / decoder blocks are replaced by stream to vector blocks.


How to reproduce:

Install gr-drm (see installation instructions in the README file)
Take an arbitrary wav file with 24 kHz sampling rate and 16 bit format
Execute audio_corrupted with the wav-file
--> Several output files are generated (pcm_*), where pcm_in_f and pcm_dec_f 
	should have the same size if the bug does not occur. Try audio_correct.grc
	for comparison.

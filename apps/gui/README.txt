To start the GUI simply run the main.py file in the console with:

python drm_transmitter_gui.py

Before you're able to run the graphical interface it is necessary to install the
gr-drm Out-Of-Tree Module for GNU Radio on your computer.

You can find these files on:

https://github.com/kit-cel/gr-drm

Please follow the steps described in the README.md of that repository to
install the packet correctly.
An automated way to install gr-drm is using PyBOMBS.
